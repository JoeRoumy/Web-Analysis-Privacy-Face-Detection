Privacy++ : 
Private mode on browsers only clears data but does not keep track of real world privacy; who is actually looking at the screen.
We propose a new web app that detects if anyone is intruding or
snooping around (looking at the screen with you).
A facial recognition model will be loaded through the API and it will
run on the client side. The webapp will keep track of the initial users, and if a new user is detected, it means someone is now intruding. The webapp will block the screen until the intruder is no longer in the vicinity of the screen. The webapp will also block the screen in case all the authorized users leave the area to increase overall privacy.
